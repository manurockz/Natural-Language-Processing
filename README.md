# Assignment 1

# PARAGRAPH:\n
Are  you  fascinated  by  the  amount  of  text  data  available  on  the  internet?  Are  you 
looking  for  ways  to  work  with  this  text  data  but  aren’t  sure  where  to  begin? 
Machines, after all, recognize numbers, not the letters of our language. And that can 
be a tricky landscape to navigate in machine learning.

Solving  an  NLP  problem  is  a  multi-stage  process.  We  need  to  clean  the  unstructured  text  data  first 
before we can even think about getting to the modeling stage. Cleaning the data consists of a few key 
steps:

#1. Split the above paragraph into sentences
#2. Split the above paragraph into words
#3. Find stem and lemma words for the given words?
“cats"
"trouble"
"troubling"
"troubled"
“having”
“Corriendo”
“at”
“was”
#4. Find stop words from the given paragraph?
#PARAGRAPH:
“The NLTK library  is  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  commonly  used  Python  libraries  for 
Natural Language Processing. NLTK supports stop word removal, and you can find the list 
of stop words in the  corpus  module. To remove stop words from a sentence, you can divide 
your text into words and then remove the word if it exits in the list of stop words provided 
by NLTK.”

#5. From the above paragraph print frequency of each word using NLTK?
